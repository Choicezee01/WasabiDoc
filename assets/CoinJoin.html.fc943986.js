For this, the client presents to the coordinator two old credentials, and two newly created ones. The coordinator does not know the amount value of any of those credentials, but it can verify, that the two pairs sum up to exactly the same value. For example, a user can present one 5 btc and one 0 btc credential, and redeem one 2 btc and one 3 btc credential. Or a user can present one 4 btc and one 1 btc credential, and redeem one 5 btc and one 0 btc credential. After potentially many rounds of reissuance, each client has exactly the amount credential it desires. Each of these reissuance is perfectly private, so the coordinator cannot link any of them to the same user.</p><p>Next, your Wasabi client generates multiple new Tor identities called <strong>Bob</strong>, which are in no way tied to any Alice. Bob sends to the Wasabi coordinator:</p><ul><li>An unblinded credential signed by the coordinator</li><li>A new unused bitcoin address</li></ul><p>Because the coordinator can verify its own credential, it knows that this credential came into existence after an input of at least this much value was registered. However, it cannot know which input exactly.</p><p>It is very important that the coordinator cannot link Alice to Bob. Because Alice has sent the cleartext input, and Bob sends the cleartext output. So, if the two were to be linked, then the coordinator can specifically link the input to the output, meaning that the anonymity set is 1. Because Alice received a credential from the coordinator, and because Bob is a new Tor identity not linked to Alice, the coordinator can verify that nobody is cheating, but it cannot deanonymize the peers.</p><p>The output registration phase ends when the value of cleartext outputs is equal to the value of inputs, meaning that all Bobs have registered.
