When you do not label all your addresses, there is no meta-data for you to understand the context of your coins. Thus receiving addresses and sending transactions should be carefully labeled with the observers who know that this address belongs to you. This helps you know where your coins came from so that you can judge whether there are privacy concerns when sending a specific coin to a specific receiver.</p><p><img src="`+c+'" alt="Wasabi Wallet known by label" title="Wasabi Wallet known by label"></p><p>When labeling a newly generated address or a sending transaction you should ask yourself: &quot;Who knows this address is mine?&quot; or &quot;Whom will I share this address with?&quot; or &quot;From whom am I receiving bitcoin?&quot; or &quot;To whom am I sending bitcoin?&quot;. Labels should contain the comma-separated names of people/entities that may be aware of the transaction and could follow its trail like:</p><p><code>Name of the sender or the receiver, name of the exchange, name of the payment processor</code></p><p>So, a good label could be:</p><p><code>Alice, &lt;name of KYC exchange&gt;, BTCPay Server</code></p><p>or:</p><p><code>Alice &amp; Bob</code> (This is one entity which is not the same as <code>Alice, Bob</code> as they are multiple entities and thus separated by a comma)</p><h3 id="how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-receive-address" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-receive-address" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How can I change the label of my receive address?</h3>',14),it=s('<p><img src="'+R+'" alt="Edit Address Label" title="Edit Address Label"></p><h3 id="how-can-i-edit-the-labels-of-my-address-after-a-transaction-has-gone-through" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-edit-the-labels-of-my-address-after-a-transaction-has-gone-through" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How can I edit the labels of my address after a transaction has gone through?</h3><p>To date there is no possibility to change the label of an address after it has sent or received bitcoins.</p><h3 id="are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Are there privacy concerns regarding whom I send my address?</h3><p>Yes.

For this reason, broadcasting transaction through your own node may reveal your IP address.</p><p>So to fix this, Wasabi broadcasts your transaction to a random node over Tor, so this node cannot detect your IP address.

When you use Wasabi, you must label every coin that you receive with the observers. The reason why this is important, is that your &quot;wallet&quot; is really just a collection of coins (similar to a physical wallet, not to a bank account). When you receive coins from somewhere to a labeled address, Wasabi will store the label locally on your device, for example:</p><p><code>----&gt; 0.65 BTC (Bob)</code></p><p>Now if you receive money from Alice who uses an exchange, then your label would look like this:</p><p><code>----&gt; 2.1 BTC (Alice, exchange)</code></p><p>Now here is where things can be a bit tricky for folks unfamiliar with Bitcoin.

The transaction graph is the history of where a coin has been, and is important if different histories need to be separated.

Once the appropriate number of participants have registered, the actual transaction (the CoinJoin) is constructed by the coordinator, and given to all participants in the span of about 60 seconds. At this point, all registered participants must sign off on the CoinJoin, and if a single one of the participants fails to sign their input, the entire CoinJoin must be restarted.</p>',13),_a={href:"https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/#d-dos-attack",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ka=s('<p>So a simple solution looks like this - the coordinator could collect signatures from all inputs, and if one or more input refuses to sign, the coordinator could record that input and temporarily (or even permanently) ban that coin from participation. This is a nice solution, as it mitigates a single coin from ruining all CoinJoins, but it too comes with trade-offs.</p><p>For example, most of the time, users fail to sign a CoinJoin for non-malicious reasons. Perhaps their Tor connection went down in precisely that moment, or perhaps their WiFi had a temporary flicker at the wrong time. Further, some users don&#39;t even realize that the signing phase is happening, and sometimes shut down their computer at exactly the wrong moment. All of these things hinder a successful CoinJoin for all other participants, but by pure accident.</p><p>If you are one of the victims of this temporary banning then simply wait for the ban to expire and try again. The best thing you can do to avoid the issue is to have a strong internet connection and keep your computer online throughout the whole process.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Note:</p><p>Banning does not mean freezing.
