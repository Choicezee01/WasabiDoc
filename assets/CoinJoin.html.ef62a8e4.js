Just leave Wasabi running in the background of your computer, as coinjoining takes time.</p><p>Remixing is free, as well as coinjoining coins 1 hop from coinjoin, although, Bitcoin network fees still do apply. So if you send a coinjoined coin and receive a change output, Wasabi will not charge you the coordinator fee for this change output again.

The coordinator sends a zero value credential to each Alice for each successful connection confirmation.</p><p>The round is abandoned and re-started if too many Alices have dropped, for example when their Wasabi is shut down, or when their Tor connection is temporarily broken.

For this, the client presents to the coordinator two old credentials, and two newly created ones. The coordinator does not know the amount value of any of those credentials, but it can verify, that the two pairs sum up to exactly the same value. For example, a user can present one 5 btc and one 0 btc credential, and redeem one 2 btc and one 3 btc credential. Or a user can present one 4 btc and one 1 btc credential, and redeem one 5 btc and one 0 btc credential. After potentially many rounds of reissuance, each client has exactly the amount credential it desires. Each of these reissuance is perfectly private, so the coordinator cannot link any of them to the same user.</p><p>Next, your Wasabi client generates multiple new Tor identities called <strong>Bob</strong>, which are in no way tied to any Alice. Bob sends to the Wasabi coordinator:</p><ul><li>An unblinded credential signed by the coordinator</li><li>A new unused bitcoin address</li></ul><p>Because the coordinator can verify its own credential, it knows that this credential came into existence after an input of at least this much value was registered. However, it cannot know which input exactly.</p><p>It is very important that the coordinator cannot link Alice to Bob. Because Alice has sent the cleartext input, and Bob sends the cleartext output. So, if the two were to be linked, then the coordinator can specifically link the input to the output, meaning that the anonymity set is 1. Because Alice received a credential from the coordinator, and because Bob is a new Tor identity not linked to Alice, the coordinator can verify that nobody is cheating, but it cannot deanonymize the peers.</p><p>The output registration phase ends when the value of cleartext outputs is equal to the value of inputs, meaning that all Bobs have registered. If after a timeout not all outputs are registered, then this round is abandoned, the missing inputs are temporarily banned, and a new round is started.</p><h3 id="signing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#signing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Signing</h3>',7),W=s('<p>Each Alice does the following:</p><ul><li>Verifies that her input and output are included.</li><li>Signs the transaction with the private key of her input.</li><li>Sends the signature to the coordinator, who verifies this information.</li></ul><p>The signing phase ends when the coordinator has received all the valid signatures for all the registered inputs.</p><h3 id="blame-round" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blame-round" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Blame round</h3><p>When the signing phase fails due to some Alices disrupting the round (failing to sign or send the signature to the coordinator), then the successful Alices will continue into a blame round.
