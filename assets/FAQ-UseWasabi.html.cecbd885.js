When you do not label all your addresses, there is no meta-data for you to understand the context of your coins. Thus receiving addresses and sending transactions should be carefully labeled with the observers who know that this address belongs to you. This helps you know where your coins came from so that you can judge whether there are privacy concerns when sending a specific coin to a specific receiver.</p><p><img src="`+c+'" alt="Wasabi Wallet known by label" title="Wasabi Wallet known by label"></p><p>When labeling a newly generated address or a sending transaction you should ask yourself: &quot;Who knows this address is mine?&quot; or &quot;Whom will I share this address with?&quot; or &quot;From whom am I receiving bitcoin?&quot; or &quot;To whom am I sending bitcoin?&quot;. Labels should contain the comma-separated names of people/entities that may be aware of the transaction and could follow its trail like:</p><p><code>Name of the sender or the receiver, name of the exchange, name of the payment processor</code></p><p>So, a good label could be:</p><p><code>Alice, &lt;name of KYC exchange&gt;, BTCPay Server</code></p><p>or:</p><p><code>Alice &amp; Bob</code> (This is one entity which is not the same as <code>Alice, Bob</code> as they are multiple entities and thus separated by a comma)</p><h3 id="how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-receive-address" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-receive-address" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How can I change the label of my receive address?</h3>',14),ct=e("em",null,"Address Awaiting Payment",-1),ut=s('<p><img src="'+H+'" alt="Edit Address Label" title="Edit Address Label"></p><h3 id="how-can-i-edit-the-labels-of-my-address-after-a-transaction-has-gone-through" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-edit-the-labels-of-my-address-after-a-transaction-has-gone-through" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How can I edit the labels of my address after a transaction has gone through?</h3><p>To date there is no possibility to change the label of an address after it has sent or received bitcoins.</p><h3 id="are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Are there privacy concerns regarding whom I send my address?</h3><p>Yes.
