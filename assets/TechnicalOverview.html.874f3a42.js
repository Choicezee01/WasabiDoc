All Internet traffic goes through Tor, and by default all this traffic stays inside the onion network. Exit nodes are only involved in fallback scenarios.</p><p>For example, if the Tor onion service of the backend becomes unavailable for the user, the wallet falls back to communicating with the backend&#39;s clearnet endpoint, still over Tor.
