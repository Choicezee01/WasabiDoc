After setting up Wasabi and generating a wallet, Wasabi welcomes the user with a <code>Load Wallet</code> screen.</p><p>Unlike other wallets, Wasabi has a convenient way to use multiple wallets. Privacy-centric users may be already used to achieving coin separation this way. However, Wasabi provides a convenient in-wallet coin separation interface too. More information will be provided about that later on.</p><p>Since coin separation can be easily achieved without multiple wallet files, initially the developers did not plan for such a wallet management system. Our UX design choices have naturally led us down this road.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="Wasabi Wallet Load Wallet tab" title="Wasabi Wallet Load Wallet tab"></p><p>Wasabi has a status bar that shows meta-information about the state of the wallet. To better understand the architecture of the wallet, it is helpful to go through the information provided.</p><p>The <code>Tor</code> label shows the status of the Tor daemon. Tor is an anonymity network which Wasabi includes and runs by default in the background. The user can also opt to use their own Tor instance. All Internet traffic goes through Tor, and by default all this traffic stays inside the onion network. Exit nodes are only involved in fallback scenarios.</p><p>For example, if the Tor onion service of the backend becomes unavailable for the user, the wallet falls back to communicating with the backend&#39;s clearnet endpoint, still over Tor. Wasabi also frequently utilizes multiple Tor streams where applicable.</p><p>Importantly, registration of CoinJoin inputs and outputs is done through different Tor streams to avoid linking.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="Wasabi Wallet Tor Status Bar" title="Wasabi Wallet Tor Status Bar"></p>',10),V={href:"https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink#ii-chaumian-coinjoin",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},O={href:"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},j=e("p",null,"It is worth pointing out that the initial design choice of a light wallet was made because such a wallet can attract orders of magnitude more users, compared to a wallet on top of a full node.

There is room for improvement there, as well. Wasabi only connects to onion peers, which facilitates end-to-end encryption, and it connects to them on a different Tor streams. After each block download Wasabi disconnects the related peer.</p><p>Furthermore, if you have a full node running in the background Wasabi won&#39;t download blocks from peers, but will instead use your full node to fetch the needed blocks.</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="Wasabi Wallet Peers Status Bar" title="Wasabi Wallet Peers Status Bar"></p><p>Wasabi receives incoming transactions from the nodes it is connected to.
