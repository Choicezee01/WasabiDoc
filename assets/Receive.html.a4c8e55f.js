Just like with gold atoms, it doesn&#39;t matter which specific gold atoms you have, as long as it&#39;s gold, it&#39;s gold. However, an unspent transaction output, a bitcoin, is a chunk of money and is not fungible, because it has a different amount of satoshis in it, a different public key locking it up, a unique transaction history, and a unique index number. This is just like a gold coin, with a unique amount of gold atoms, and either a pretty mintage or an old chipped broken coin. Because UTXOs are not fungible, it is very important to know exactly which coin is which, and that is done by carefully labeling.</p><p>For example, if I create a new address to receive a <code>0.5 BTC</code> payment from Andrew for a laptop that I sold to him then the label has to be: <code>Andrew</code>.</p><p>The label is not for describing the <code>reason for payment</code>, but rather to list those who know that this address is yours. Understanding this difference between labeling an address and describing a transaction is very important for your privacy.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>In Wasabi it is mandatory to give every receive address a label of those who know that this address is yours, so that later you know what to do with it, and it also helps the auto coin selection algorithm when sending.</p></div><h3 id="clusters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clusters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Clusters</h3><p>Following the previous example, if I have to send a fraction (<code>0.1 BTC</code>) of the previously received coin to Charlie then in the <code>Send</code> tab the observers should be: <code>Charlie</code>. In that way, the change (<code>0.4 BTC</code>) will be known by Andrew and Charlie because they both will be able to follow the change. That&#39;s exactly what Wasabi displays in the coins list (cluster column), Wasabi tells us who are the ones that know about each of our coins in order to allow us to decide what to do with the coins.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at another example: Imagine you have three coins, one known by Alice, one known by a KYC exchange and finally one known by Charlie. Imagine you need to sell a few sats to Charlie, which coin/s should you send? The obvious selection is the one already known by Charlie because by doing that he cannot learn anything new about our wallet, moreover, neither Alice nor the KYC exchange can learn anything new! But what if the coin is not big enough and we need to use more than one coin? You can use the one known by Alice or the one known by the KYC exchange, but are you okay with Charlie knowing about your deposit/withdrawal from the exchange? Are you okay with Alice knowing about your deal with Charlie? In case none of those combinations are acceptable for you then you should CoinJoin your coins.</p><h3 id="coinjoined-coins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coinjoined-coins" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CoinJoined coins</h3>',10),C=l(`<h3 id="final-words-about-labels-and-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-words-about-labels-and-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final words about labels and examples</h3><p>4 coins with good labels:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>Andrew

Not really.).</p><p>So, think about coins, think about who knows and make sure to make decisions about privacy based on what you are going to reveal and to whom.
