# Explain Wasabi like I'm 5

Wasabi is a Bitcoin wallet, tailor-made to protect your privacy.
It is a piece of software that runs on your computer and helps you to manage your bitcoins.
You can generate a new set of private keys, or import already existing ones.
With Wasabi you can receive bitcoins to your full control, and you can send them to someone else without permission.
There is also a powerful CoinJoin feature to help obfuscate your transaction history.
