# Explain Wasabi like I'm 5

[[toc]]

## Introduction

Wasabi is a Bitcoin wallet, tailor-made to protect your privacy.
It is a piece of software that runs on your computer and helps you to manage your bitcoins.
You can generate a new set of private keys, or import already existing ones.
With Wasabi you can receive bitcoins to your full control, and you can send them to someone else without permission.
There is also a powerful CoinJoin feature to help obfuscate your transaction history.

## Installing Wasabi

Installing Wasabi is super easy.
Go to the official website [wasabiwallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io), scroll down and download the version for your operating system.
You can then install Wasabi as you would do any other software on your computer.

See [this chapter](/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.md) for a detailed step-by-step tutorial for all operating systems, and also how to verify the PGP signature.
