# Explain Wasabi like I'm 5

[[toc]]

## Introduction

Wasabi is a Bitcoin wallet, tailor-made to protect your privacy.
It is a piece of software that runs on your computer and helps you to manage your bitcoins.
You can generate a new set of private keys, or import already existing ones.
With Wasabi you can receive bitcoins to your full control, and you can send them to someone else without permission.
There is also a powerful CoinJoin feature to help obfuscate your transaction history.

## Installing Wasabi

Installing Wasabi is super easy.
Go to the official website [wasabiwallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io), scroll down and download the version for your operating system.
You can then install Wasabi as you would do any other software on your computer.

See [this chapter](/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.md) for a detailed step-by-step tutorial for all operating systems, and also how to verify the PGP signature.

## Generating a Wallet

When for the first time you start Wasabi, it will open in the tab to generate a new wallet.
You can set a unique name for the wallet so that you remember what it is for.
Choose a very secure password, as this encrypts the secrets, and should not be guessed by others.
You will always need this password when you want to spend your bitcoins, so take great care to back it up properly.
In the next step, Wasabi will show your 12 recovery words, these must be carefully backed up also, as they can help you access your bitcoins when your computer breaks.

See [this chapter](/using-wasabi/WalletGeneration.md) for more information on how to securely generate your wallet.
