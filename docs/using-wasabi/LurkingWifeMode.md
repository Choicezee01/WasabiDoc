## More information on LWM
- In LWM the wallet is still usable, which means input field information isn't hidden.
- LWM only masks the surface.
This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in LWM mode, for example like clicking on an expander, LWM won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234).
