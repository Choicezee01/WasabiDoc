## Wallet Explorer

On the right side of Wasabi is the `Wallet Explorer`, where you see an alphabetically sorted list of all the previously [generated](/using-wasabi/WalletGeneration.md) wallets.

You can load a wallet simply by double clicking on it or by right-clicking on it and then choosing `Load Wallet`.
A coin will appear on the wallet icon to indicate the loaded wallets.
