## Whonix Overview

Whonix is a free and open-source desktop operating system (OS) that is specifically designed for advanced security and privacy.
Based on Tor, Debian GNU/Linux and the principle of security by isolation, Whonix realistically addresses common attack vectors while maintaining usability.
Online anonymity and censorship circumvention is attainable via fail-safe, automatic and desktop-wide use of the Tor network, meaning all connections are forced through Tor or blocked.

The Whonix OS consists of two VMs: the Whonix Gateway and the Whonix Workstation.
The former runs Tor processes and acts as a proxy, while the latter runs user applications on a completely isolated network.
